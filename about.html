		<h2>Background</h2>	
			<p>I grew up in a small town in Connecticut called Darien. At 13, my family and I moved to Shanghai, China where we lived for four years. During that time I was able to travel around Asia and escape the suburban bubble that I had been born into.

		<h2>Travels</h2>
			<p>In the past 8 years, I have lived in 3 different countries, each within a different continent and hemisphere. Between living in the USA, China, and Paraguay, I had the convenience of being able to travel to many cities in 22 countries.</p>

		<h2>Studies</h2>
			<p>After attending 6 different highschools in multiple countries, I wanted to choose a College that I would be able to call home for four years. I am currently a 3rd year Journalism + Design major at Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts at The New School. </p>
