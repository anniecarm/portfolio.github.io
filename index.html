		<blockquote>"Mass incarceration is another form of jim crow laws and therefore an extension of slavery, but because men are being convicted of a crime, they are seen as criminals and not victims of a racist system that does not want them to succeed. This country cannot move forward if it allows entire populations to be systematically held back time and time again."</blockquote>
